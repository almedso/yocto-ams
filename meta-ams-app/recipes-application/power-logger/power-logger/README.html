The power logger application runs as  systemd service, named *power-logger*.
</p><p>

Use systemctl to manage
```
systemctl status power-logger.service
systemctl start power-logger.service
systemctl stop power-logger.service
```
</p><p>

The service file is specified at the usual place:

```
vi /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/power-logger.service
```
</p><p>

The power power consumption logger application *pcl* can be explored by
</p><p>

```

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --host HOST           The the hostname: if not set cmatic-D9CD14 is used if host is set to 'simulate' artificial values (0.1) are delivered without invoking the web service
  --storage STORAGE     Set a storage directory: if not set current directory is used
  -p PERIOD, --period PERIOD
                        Period where the readout happens (in seconds), if not set the program reads once and writes to console

<h2>Web publishing</h2>

<p>

Web publishing is done via nginx service.
</p><p>

```
systemctl status nginx.service
```
</p><p>

The service serves standard port 80 via http.
The local directory root that is served is */var/www/ams-ref-spa/html*.
This is where the power-logger service writes into.
